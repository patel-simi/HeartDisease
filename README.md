### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Support Vector Machine, also known as SVM, is an effective classification program that is utilizes a hyperplane, a line or plane, to split data into two different class labels. The support vectors, data points close that anchor and position the hyperplane, are used to help calculate the marginal lines. 
The goal of a SVM is to maximize the margin lines parallel to the hyperplane to increase the classification performance.

### Binary Classification Neural Network
Neural Networks are a powerful classification method utilitizes neurons, weights, connections, bias, and activation functions. Neural Networks have many different purposes and can produce a variety of results depending on what the desired output is. A neural network consists of several hidden layers each layer with connections amongst the neurons that work together to identify unrecognizable patterns within the input and output through the connections of neurons. The connections implement the weight and bias into the activiation function to produce an output used for the next layer of neurons. 
There are two different propogations to feed a neural network through training- forward, backward. Backward propogation will go output to input neurons to calculate the error gradients to minimize loss by rearranging the weights to increase accuracy. Forward propogation moves from input to output to process the data and produce the output.
When a neural network is used for classification, its known as an artificial neural network. 
Depending on the connection The different ways of connecting the neurons can unlock unrecognizable patterns that will be used to predict the next layer within the neural network.
The method was more used to reduce the prediction error and to confirm the previous method was relatively accurate.
